# androidAudioDock
Here lies code for a mobile phone dock that:

+Charges the phone using 12v-5v power conversion (TODO: make it charge at max rate)
+Establishes USB digital audio connection and pumps audio through high-quality CODEC
+Intercepts CAN bus messages to provide media control via steering wheel controls

OEM project created for use with the Microchip Technology PIC32 BT DevKit (DV320032). Functionality supports Android only (USB host) audio + working media transport controls.
