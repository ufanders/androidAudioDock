# androidAudioDock
Here lies code for a mobile phone dock that:

-Charges the phone using 12v-5v power conversion (TODO: make it charge at max rate).
-Establishes USB digital audio connection and pumps audio through high-quality CODEC.
-Intercepts CAN bus messages to provide media control via steering wheel controls.
